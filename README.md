A mathematical simulation of genetic drift that expands on the Hardy-Weinberg principle.
This is a fun side-project that I am currently working on. You can still submit a pull request or highlight issues!

<h2>Hardy-Weinberg principle</h2>

The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium is a concept in population genetics that states allele (genotype) frequencies will remain constant throughout generations. The formula for it is:

```
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1

Values:
p^2 = dominant homozygous frequency
2pq = heterozygous frequency
q^2 = recessive homozygous frequency
```

Assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium:

1. No mutations (alterations of nucleic acid)
2. Panmixia (random mating: all individuals are potential partners)
3. Large, ideally infinite, population size
4. No gene flow
5. No natural selection, the driver of evolution

Drifter aims to simulate genetic drift in a large variety of genes without the preassumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle.
